Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is the <strong>standard markup language</strong>[a] for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser.<br>
It defines the <u>content</u> and <u>structure</u> of web content.<br> 
It is often assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages such as JavaScript, a programming language.<br>
Web browsers receive HTML documents from a <strong>web server</strong> or from <strong>local storage</strong> and render the documents into multimedia web pages.<br> 
HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for its appearance.<br>
HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages.<br> 
With HTML constructs, images and other objects such as interactive forms may be embedded into the rendered page.<br>
HTML provides a means to create structured documents by denoting structural semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes, and other items.<br>
HTML elements are delineated by tags, written using angle brackets. Tags such as <img> and <input> directly introduce content into the page.
